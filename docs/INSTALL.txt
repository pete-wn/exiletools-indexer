This is not intended to be a complete walkthrough. Setting up the Indexer Core and getting it running will
require some experimentation and systems knowledge.

The production and development versions run on CentOS7, but have also been installed with ease on Ubuntu. 
No testing has been done on Windows/etc.

To get this up and running:

1. Install, configure and start Elasticsearch
2. Edit the bin/tools/setup/es-recreate* files with a proper index name, then run them
3. Edit the config file in the root directory and set a proper basedir and index names that match step 2, as well as kafka topics
4. mkdir -p the basedir and basedir/logs/offset
5. Install Apache Kafka and get it up and running, create the appropriate topics and partitions
6. Install perl, cpanminus, and all required perl modules (see below)
7. Start by running incoming-monitor-ggg-stashtab-api.pl and make sure it works and that information is going into Kafka
8. Run process-reformat-ggg-to-pwx.pl -partition 0 first and make sure it's working. It may be slow to index at first as the
   ElasticSearch mappings are dynamically created.
9. Once everything is confirmed to be working, activate the other threads for processing and/or put it into supervisor and go

Good luck. :o

You can use the example supervisord configuration file to set this to be run automatically.

The first few runs may be slow as Elasticsearch builds the proper mappings, but everything should speed up before too long.

You can also copy everything in www/html to your nginx or apache root directory and get access to the dashboard/etc. stuff,
though you will need to change the URL's in them to your local install of elasticsearch for everything to work.

* Notes on installing stuff on centos for my own machines:

** Perl
cpanm TODDR/IO-1.36_01.tar.gz LWP::UserAgent JSON JSON::XS Encode utf8::all Date::Parse Time::HiRes Search::Elasticsearch Text::Unidecode Data::Dumper Storable File::Slurp Try::Tiny Scalar::Util Kafka String::Random Hijk

** Kafka

Create topics:

/eti/kafka/current/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 4 --topic incoming
/eti/kafka/current/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic processed

Delete topics (kafka has to be configured for this):

/eti/kafka/current/bin/kafka-topics.sh --delete --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic incoming
/eti/kafka/current/bin/kafka-topics.sh --delete --zookeeper localhost:2181 --topic processed

List topics:

/eti/kafka/current/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --list
